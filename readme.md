**AWS Boto3 Code Snippets**

- Restore from Glacier to S3 standard using Python.
- Export the Swagger Documentation of all the APIs deployed in API Gateway.
- Export the users from Cognito Pool to an Excel. Also allows you to export the standard user import header file. AWS doesn't provide a feature to export the users from a pool. Code to restore to a new pool in Cognito is in progress.
